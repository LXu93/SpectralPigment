"<h5>Introduction</h5><ul><li> Welcome to the interactive database of appearance of ancient polychromy. Here you will find multiangle spectral data and texture images of marble mock-ups painted with different pigments, binders, and ground layers, corresponding to real traces of pigments found in ancient marble sculptures. </li><li>This database is part of the PERCEIVE project, which aims to virtually reconstruct the appearance of ancient marble sculptures. For more information, visit: <a href='https://perceive-horizon.eu'>PERCEIVE</a>.</li></ul>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
    st.markdown("<h5>Mock-up fabrication</h5><ul><li> The mock-ups were fabricated based on analytical results of polychromy traces found on ancient sculptures housed at the MANN museum in Naples. Based on these results, we made different combinations of possible paints. There are two types of <b>marble</b>: Paros and Pentelic, two types of <b>binder</b>: Punic wax and egg white, several <b>pigments</b>: Egyptian blue, Cinnabar, Red lake, Red and Yellow ochre, and green earth, different <b>ground layers</b>: lead white, calcite, lead white mixed with Egyptian blue, no ground, and multiple combinations of secondary and tertiary mixtures as well as <b>overlapping pigment layers</b>.</li><li>This experimental investigation aims to understand how all these different factors can contribute to the final appearance of the polychrome sculptures.</li><li>The mock-ups were fabricated at the Institute for Heritage Science (ISPC), CNR in Florence.</li></ul>", unsafe_allow_html=True)

The wavelength range is of 400 to 700 nm with a 10 nm step, and the light source is a white LED with blue enhancement.</li><li>The MA-T12 also has a camera for texture images positioned at 15 degrees from the normal, and the size of the texture area is of 0.9 x 1.2 cm.</li></ul>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
