# Interactive Ancient Polychromy Database 
https://ancientpolychromy.streamlit.app/

The website has three modes:
- **Single mock-up**ï¼š this mode allows users to select one mock-up from the table to display its reflectance spectra on an interactive plot. Users also have the option to download the plot as a PNG file and the spectral data as a CSV file.
- **Comparison**: In this mode, users can select multiple mock-ups to compare their spectral reflectance. The plotted curve for each mock-up represents the reflectance spectrum at a 0/45 geometry. Users also have the option to download the plot as a PNG file and the spectral data as a CSV file.
- **Texture image**: Texture image mode allows users to select a mock-up from the table to display its texture photos.

In the Single mock-up mode and the Comparison mode, users have two option for colors of plotted curves:
- **Corresponding color mode**: In this mode, each curve is clolored by the color corresponding to the measured spectral reflectance.
- **Distinct mode**: In this mode, random colors are used for coloring curves.
